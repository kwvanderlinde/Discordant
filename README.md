# Discordant

A Minecraft-Discord bridge targeting the latest Minecraft version and focused on consistent and convenient configurations.

## Development

This project is a fork of the discontinued [Discordium Mod](https://github.com/CmdrJane/Discordium) by CmdrJane. Discordant was started to bring that excellent beginning to future Minecraft versions, while hoping to develop the code base into a work of art.

The main development takes place on the `develop` branch. This branch always targets the latest Minecraft version targeted by discordant as that is all that we will focus on for the time being.
